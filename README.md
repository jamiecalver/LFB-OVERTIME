# LFB-OVERTIME
There is a need to develop an overtime system for the London Fire Brigade to allow users to sign up for overtime, as well as for system admins (known as RMC) to view who is available. This system has a FF side, and an RMC side.
The file starting with as V followed by a subsequent version number is the users side. This allows users to add themself to the database, as well as edit their account and attach their availability for their four days off.
One issue I have highlighted thus far is the fact any user can edit anyone else as long as they know their pay number. This could be used maliciously. A solution could be to have the edit user on the admin file, and any edits to users will have to be requested.
